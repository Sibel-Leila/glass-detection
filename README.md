SII - project

We studied the articole: "Seeing Glassware: from Edge Detection to Pose Estimation and Shape Recovery" available at 
	https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/efcc/2098f7f9637c7db9b9f7ac4c3294578e12ca.pdf

Now we try to implement this algorithm using python

Need to install:
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install opencv-python
